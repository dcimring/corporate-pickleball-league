# Hero Section Static Background Options

Based on the **"Night Court Electric"** aesthetic, here are 3 distinct suggestions for a static background or texture to improve the Hero section. These options focus on visual depth, texture, and atmosphere without relying on complex animations.

## Option 1: "Carbon Fiber Mesh"
**Vibe:** Premium, High-Performance, Sleek.
**Concept:**
A dark, textured background mimicking the surface of a high-end pickleball paddle or a technical sportswear fabric.
*   **Visuals:** A repeating SVG pattern of interlocking "weaves" or small hexagons in very dark navy tones (`#0F172A` and `#1E293B`).
*   **Detail:** A subtle, static radial gradient (lighter navy) in the center acts as a spotlight to ensure legibility of the main text.
*   **Why:** Evokes the equipment and gear of the sport. It feels professional ("Corporate") and modern.

## Option 2: "Halftone Court"
**Vibe:** Retro-Sport, Print Media, Bold.
**Concept:**
A graphic design-heavy approach using a large halftone dot pattern overlay.
*   **Visuals:** A pattern of dots that start large at the edges and become smaller toward the center (or vice-versa), creating a vignette effect purely through geometry. Behind the text is a massive, stroked outline of a pickleball court, rotated 15 degrees, in a very faint `brand-acid` color (5% opacity).
*   **Why:** Leans into the "Night Court" aesthetic with a poster-like quality. It feels like a flyer for an underground tournament.

## Option 3: "Neon Noise Blueprint"
**Vibe:** Tactical, Gritty, Industrial.
**Concept:**
A "Game Plan" look. The background features a heavy film grain or CSS noise texture for grit.
*   **Visuals:** Beneath the noise, faint "blueprint" style markings are visible: court dimensions, angles, X's and O's representing plays, and technical measurements. These lines are fine, static, and low-opacity white or green.
*   **Detail:** A "vignette" effect darkens the corners significantly to focus attention.
*   **Why:** "Corporate" implies strategy. This background looks like a tactical breakdown of a winning play, fitting for a league centered on stats and competition.
